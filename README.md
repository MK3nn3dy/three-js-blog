# Mathew Kennedy - Three js Blog #

## A Website to Log my Three js Development Journey ##

*This project contains imports of my own Cinema 4D projects and settings specific to them, but feel free to download it as a working template of three js integrated with React.*

---

**Purpose**

I'm simply trying to practice integrating react with three js, and in the process create a blog outlining my 3D web development journey as we move swiftly towards a more immersive, exciting web!

---

**Plans for the Future**

- [ ] I plan to develop this portion of my portfolio into an immersive space where I'll show off my 3D models, giving credit to tutorial series where due.

- [ ] I also plan to use <a href="https://graphql.org">GraphQL</a> and <a href="https://mongoosejs.com">Mongoose</a> and display blog posts about this journey in a separate componenent, once I have finished my first few models!
