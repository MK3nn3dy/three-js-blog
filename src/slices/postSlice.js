            description: "This is my first real attempt at an environment in Cinema 4D, though a long time ago I did a little work in Maya and Blender. I followed detailed instructions by MOBOX graphics with slight modifications of my own. This was a great way to learn Cinema 4D'smost popular tools and parametric objects, allowing me to create recognisable objects whilst keeping a low poly-count for three js.\n\nThis was my introduction to the gltf format, and successfully importing this model onto this website is how I locked in the basics of my Cinema 4D to Three JS workflow. It was also where I used to learn dat.gui for lighting, positioning, and debugging."

            description: "This was the first time I modelled with no tutorial, deciding for myself which tools to use. I learned a lot more about materials and shadows, and how to bake and export them optimally for Three JS. I also learned how to access, play, and manipulate Cinema 4D animation takes in Three. The workflow from Cinema 4D to Three JS is clicking, and I've realised most tutorials online are based around Blender. This has inspired me to refine the Cinema 4D to Three JS workflow further and to share what I learn on Github, and potentially YouTube."

            title: "Perceptron",
            description: "At the time of this post, I'm also following along with the Neural Networks from Scratch book by Harrison Kinsley and Daniel KukieÅ‚a. I thought a basic multi-layered perceptron would be a good project to practice modelling in Cinema 4D and to import and interact with in three js. This project, I focused on camera movements with TWEEN, a Three JS animation library. The descriptions of this model here are very simple. Anyone interested in learning more should definitely check out the Neural Networks from Scratch book and YouTube series."
