                        This is my first real attempt at an environment in Cinema 4D, though a long time ago I did a little work in Maya and Blender. 
                        I follow detailed instructions by MOBOX graphics with slight modifications of my own. This was a great way to learn Cinema 4D's
                        most popular tools and parametric objects, allowing me to create recognisable objects whilst keeping a low poly-count for three js.<br/>
                        This was my introduction to the gltf format, and successfully importing this model onto this website is how I locked in the basics of
                        my Cinema 4D to Three JS workflow. It was also where I used to learn dat.gui for lighting, positioning, and debugging.
